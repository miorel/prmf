Here's my accelerated guide to setting up Eclipse to work with our version control system. This might be a bit daunting the first time you do it if you're not familiar with these technologies, so if you reach an impasse, feel free to contact me. I can also help you set this up if we meet in person. Without further ado, the guide:

  * download and install [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse]
  * install [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subclipse]
   * fire up Eclipse
   * go to Help, Software Updates, Find and Install
   * continue following the [http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA online instructions]
   * if something breaks (as often happens on CISE systems), you can install Subclipse from an archived site rather than a remote site: download [http://subclipse.tigris.org/files/documents/906/47423/site-1.6.10.zip site-1.6.10.zip]
  * in Eclipse, create a new project
   * select New, Project..., SVN, Checkout Projects from SVN
   * add the repository location
   * input your credentials when prompted
   * only get the trunk directory, we'll deal with tags and branches later as needed
   * say you want the New Project wizard when asked and configure it as a Java project
   * sit back, relax, the download will finish shortly
