= The Basics =
Packaged with all of the source code is lovely file entitled "Build.xml"; it is the one that will be doing all of the hard work for you. 

Assuming you are on the CISE computers, you should already have Ant installed. 

In the Terminal, navigate to the directory in which the bot files are stored.
(If you used the default workspace directory in eclipse this should just be:<br>
/YOUR HOME FOLDER/workspace/mafiabot/

From here type "*ant run*". This will compile all of the source code, create the jar, and then execute it. Congratulations, you are finished! (Unless you want...*Fancier Stuff*)

== Fancier Stuff ==


 * You'll notice that whenever you run the code each line looks something like the following:
     `[`java`]` <<<< :jordan.freenode.net NOTICE `*` :`***` Looking up your hostname...<br>
     `[`java`]` <<<< :jordan.freenode.net NOTICE `*` :`***` Checking Ident

 That extra space at the front and the `[`java`]` bits can be removed by using the -e option when running ant (i.e. "*ant -e run*")


 * In the event that you change you code, and running the bot doesn't seem to reflect it, you may need to clean out the class files.
 This can be done by typing "ant clean". (For extra fanciness you can use the command "*ant clean run*" (which of course can be couple with *-e* for _extreme_ fancy:
 "*ant clean -e run*"))
