#summary A quick introduction to the inner workings of TWW2Bot.

= Introduction =

TWW2Bot is written using the PircBot API which can be found at http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php and it will only compile if PircBot is downloaded and placed in the same directory. I will point out that it is very badly hacked together code. When I get around to it, I will add a master list of valid commands to this page. A lot of channel op commands have been commented out because they're not really necessary in the context that I generally use TWW2Bot. Feel free to laugh at how badly coded it is, basically I went for the as long as it works strategy.
