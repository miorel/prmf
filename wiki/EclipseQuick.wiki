Here's an accelerated guide to setting up Eclipse to work with our version control system. If you are working on the CISE systems in the dungeon, there is a more specific [EclipseCiseHowTo Eclipse CISE How-to], complete with screenshots!

  * download and install [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse]
  * install [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subclipse]
   * fire up Eclipse
   * go to Help, Software Updates, Find and Install
   * continue following the [http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA online instructions]
   * if something breaks (as often happens on CISE systems), you can install Subclipse from an archived site rather than a remote site: download [http://subclipse.tigris.org/files/documents/906/47423/site-1.6.10.zip site-1.6.10.zip]
  * in Eclipse, create a new project
   * select New, Project..., SVN, Checkout Projects from SVN
   * add the repository location: [https://prmf.googlecode.com/svn/]
   * input [https://code.google.com/hosting/settings your credentials] when prompted
   * only get the project directory from the trunk, we'll deal with tags and branches later if needed
   * say you want the New Project wizard when asked and configure it as a Java project
   * sit back, relax, the download will finish shortly
