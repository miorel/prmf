	* htaccess: Added basic Apache configuration setting the DirectoryIndex and
	  enabling CGI handling for .pl files, as well as forbidding access to .db
	  and .pm files.
	* login.pl, register.pl: Refactored to use new module PRMF::Auth.
	* show_category.pl, show_question.pl: Created a couple of new pages.
	* Makefile: Included htaccess in distribution tarball, as well as
	  Mindmeld.pm (which got neglected before) and the new show_category.pl and
	  show_question.pl. Made permissions within  distribution more restrictive.
	  Removed j flag from tar command (for better portability, I think),
	  instead piping output through bzip2.
	* index.pl, Mindmeld.pm: Abstracted away some of the SQL. Made some worse.

	* Makefile: Threw together a quick Makefile. Comes with two rules so far
	  (besides clean): one to regenerate the question database, one to create
	  a distribution tarball for easy deployment.
	* mm.db: Removing question database from the repository now that it can
	  just be regenerated during the build process.
	* Mindmeld.pm, index,pl, amino_acids.pl, states.pl: Reduced code
	  duplication (and improved cleanliness a bit) by moving a few things into
	  a (very bad) module.
	* register.pl, login.pl: Hacked together a registration and login script,
	  using Digest::SHA to avoid storing plaintext passwords, as well as per
	  user salts. Some basic validation is applied (length, characters used).

	* index.pl: Added concept of categories, which may be enabled or disabled
	  through a new options page.
	* amino_acids.pl: Generator script for questions about the amino acid
	  abbreviations.
	* mm.db, states.db: Renamed database file now that there's more than one
	  topic.
	* states.pl: Updated generator script to use new database schema.

	* index.pl: Moved deck outside file, to a SQLite database. Added support
	  for grades on a 0 to 5 scale (at least, that's what the web interface
	  allows: the database schema just declares the grade as a real). Questions
	  now asked randomly from those with lowest grade. Implmented basic
	  statistics page to show grade distribution.
	* states.db: Database with questions about the US state capitals. 
	* states.pl: Generator script for the question database.

	* index.pl: Basic script that asks a random question from a hard-coded
	  deck.
