	* codegen/codegen.pl: Created user/question relationship class to hold
	  question grades and user/category relationship class to hold
	* set_grade.pl: Sets grades for the logged-in user, does nothing if no
	  user is logged in.
	* show_question.pl: Doesn't show grade anymore (because it's no longer a
	  question attribute).
  	* codegen/codegen.pl: Associated questions and categories to a user via the
  	  "author" attribute. Changed schema for categories to allow duplicate
  	  names if the users are different.
	* import.pl: Page for importing questions in Mnemosyne XML format.
	* edit_question.pl: Page for editing a question if you are its owner.
	* stats.pl, options.pl: Now require a user to be logged in, showing grade
	  statistics and active categories for that user, respectively.
	* mm.ico: 16x16 shortcut icon.
	* MindMeld.pm: Removed all the various SQL constants as they're not being
	  used anymore. Changed layout to create rounded corners using some <div>s
	  and images. Included shortcut icon.
	* green.css: Added style for the new elements.
	* circle.svg: Circle picture that can be used to generate the rounded
	  corner images.
	* questions/symbols.pl: Added code for periodic table questions.
	* mindmeld.xcf, mindmeld.png: Deleted Gimp-format logo.
	* logo.pl: New script to generate SVG logo.
	* show_category.pl, css/green.css: Fancied up the category page a bit,
	  added view and edit links for questions.
	* lib: Added directory for "library" files.
	* lib/header.pl: A basic header to be included in all page files.
	* lib/svg.pl: Script containing a couple of subs for writing SVG files.
	* Makefile: Added make rules for the rounded corner images and for the new
	  SVG logo. Lots of cleanup.
	* todo.pl: To-do list.

2011-07-22  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* codegen/codegen.pl: Started making use of foreign keys. Implemented
	  destroy() method for deleting objects from database (but I don't think I
	  can do anything about existing references to now invalid objects). Added
	  expiration attribute to sessions.
	* MindMeld.pm: Updated _dbh() method to create the proper tables if the
	  database file didn't exist. Refactored login handling in a few new
	  methods. Started enforcing session expiration.
	* questions/amino_acids.pl, questions/states.pl: Removed code that ensured
	  schemata as it's no longer necessary here.
	* logout.pl: Implemented log out page.
	* set_grade.pl, study.pl: Non-integer grades now allowed after changing
	  grade links to image map box.
	* pixel.png: Single transparent pixel image (for use in image maps).

2011-07-20  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* codegen/codegen.pl: Code generation now allows attributes to name
	  constraints. Generated create() and retrieve() now allow specifying
	  attribute values (to set initialy, and search by, respectively).
	  Overloaded stringify ("") of generated classes to give the id.
	* questions/amino_acids.pl, questions/states.pl: Changed to use improved
	  constructors.
	* css/green.css: Moved stylesheet outside of code.
	* study.pl: Using visibiliy:hidden rather than display:none for initial
	  hiding of the answer.
	* index.pl: Added registration form. Some cosmetic changes.
	* MindMeld.pm: Changed header() to produce valid HTML5. Added code for
	  log in form, using cookies to establish a session, rather insecurely (no
	  server-side session expiration, no ). Currently causes a few quirks
	  with pages that expect other parameters.
	* login.pl, register.pl: Deleting, as their function is now implemented
	  elsewhere.

2011-07-19  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* codegen, codegen/codegen.pl, codegen/exec.sh, codegen/pipe.pl: Playing
	  with some code generation for Perl packages to abstract away the SQL.
	* index.pl, options.pl, set_grade.pl, stats.pl, study.pl: Refactored into
	  multiple files, started taking advantage of some of the generated code.
	* MindMeld.pm, questions/amino_acids.pl, show_category.pl, show_question.pl,
	  questions/states.pl: Mostly refactoring to work with generated code.

2011-07-17  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* mindmeld.xcf, mindmeld.png, Makefile: Made a simple logo (and added it to
	  the distribution tarball through the Makefile).
	* MindMeld.pm: Changed header to use the logo and a bit of CSS.
	* index.pl: Home page now shows a brief description of the project and a 
	  YouTube video of Spock!

2011-07-14  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* htaccess: Added basic Apache configuration setting the DirectoryIndex and
	  enabling CGI handling for .pl files, as well as forbidding access to .db
	  and .pm files.
	* login.pl, register.pl: Refactored to use new module PRMF::Auth.
	* show_category.pl, show_question.pl: Created a couple of new pages.
	* Makefile: Included htaccess in distribution tarball, as well as
	  MindMeld.pm (which got neglected before) and the new show_category.pl and
	  show_question.pl. Made permissions within  distribution more restrictive.
	  Removed j flag from tar command (for better portability, I think),
	  instead piping output through bzip2.
	* index.pl, MindMeld.pm: Abstracted away some of the SQL. Made some worse.

2011-06-30  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* Makefile: Threw together a quick Makefile. Comes with two rules so far
	  (besides clean): one to regenerate the question database, one to create
	  a distribution tarball for easy deployment.
	* mm.db: Removing question database from the repository now that it can
	  just be regenerated during the build process.
	* MindMeld.pm, index,pl, questions/amino_acids.pl, questions/states.pl:
	  Reduced code duplication (and improved cleanliness a bit) by moving a few
	  things into a (very bad) module.
	* register.pl, login.pl: Hacked together a registration and login script,
	  using Digest::SHA to avoid storing plaintext passwords, as well as per
	  user salts. Some basic validation is applied (length, characters used).

2011-06-26  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* index.pl: Added concept of categories, which may be enabled or disabled
	  through a new options page.
	* questions/amino_acids.pl: Generator script for questions about the amino acid
	  abbreviations.
	* mm.db, states.db: Renamed database file now that there's more than one
	  topic.
	* questions/states.pl: Updated generator script to use new database schema.

2011-06-26  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* index.pl: Moved deck outside file, to a SQLite database. Added support
	  for grades on a 0 to 5 scale (at least, that's what the web interface
	  allows: the database schema just declares the grade as a real). Questions
	  now asked randomly from those with lowest grade. Implmented basic
	  statistics page to show grade distribution.
	* states.db: Database with questions about the US state capitals. 
	* questions/states.pl: Generator script for the question database.

2011-06-25  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* index.pl: Basic script that asks a random question from a hard-coded
	  deck.
