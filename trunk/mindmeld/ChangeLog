	* index.pl: Moved deck outside file, to a SQLite database. Added support
	  for grades on a 0 to 5 scale (at least, that's what the web interface
	  allows: the database schema just declares the grade as a real). Questions
	  now asked randomly from those with lowest grade. Implmented basic
	  statistics page to show grade distribution.
	* states.db: Database with questions about the US state capitals. 
	* states.pl: Generator script for the question database.
