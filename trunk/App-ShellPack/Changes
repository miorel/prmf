	* Makefile.PL: Improved robustness of Makefile generation (in theory).
	* liv/App/ShellPack.pm: Added some basic POD. Advancing version to
	  0.00_02 (still under development).
	* t/boilerplate.t: Removed, as it wasn't needed.
	* t/00-load.t, t/pod-coverage.t, t/pod.t: Small stylistic changes.
	* t/manifest.t: Removed environment variable condition. Let's make
	  everyone run this test!
	* t/App-ShellPack.t: Added stub test based on h2xs output.

	* lib/App/ShellPack.pm: The module now outputs a bash function rather
	  than a bash script because that's the use case that currently
	  interests me. Eventually I hope to make the behavior configurable.

	* ., ignore.txt: Set svn:ignore on the directory to the contents of
	  ignore.txt then deleted ignore.txt.
	* lib/App/ShellPack.pm: Implemented basic module functionality.
	  Commented out most POD -- will reintroduce later. Versioned as
	  0.00_01 (under development).
	* script, script/shellpack: Began wrapper script for the module.
	* Makefile.PL: Listed script/shellpack under EXE_FILES, made a few
	  cosmetic changes.
