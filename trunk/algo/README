This directory contains the LaTeX source for the algorithm packet.

To generate a pdf, execute the command `pdflatex algo.tex' THREE times. This 
ensures that all references are resolved, the table of contents is built, etc.

Alternatively, look into the Rubber project:
<http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~beffara/soft/rubber/>
Then you can `rubber --pdf algo.tex` instead.
