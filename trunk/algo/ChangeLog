	* .: Added googlecode.config to svn:ignore, so that people don't end
	  up uploading their Google Code credentials (see below).
	* Makefile: The pdflatex commands are wrapped in {} now instead of ().
	* gc_upload.pl, googlecode.config.example: Created script (and example
	  configuration) for uploading the algorithm packet and source archive
	  to the Downloads section of the Google Code repository. I'm not sure
	  if this script belongs in the source archive, defaulting to no, as
	  anyone who might run this ought to have the source from the
	  repository anyway.
	* test.pl: Created script for checking that the algorithm packet and
	  source archive build successfully. Reports through exit code. It may
	  be useful to have a post-commit hook run this script and make fun of
	  anyone adding broken stuff to the repository. Unlike the other
	  script, this one might have a purpose in a source archive, will
	  think about it.

	* README, toc.pl: Fixed some quotes.
	* algo.tex: Updated header in anticipation of a new wave of
	  contributions.

	* Makefile: Replaced use of the which command with the type command.
	  Defined some commands (namely rubber and zip) and their
	  corresponding flags as variables, thus making the build process more
	  configurable. Yay!
	* algo.tex: Corrected some embarrassing spelling/grammar mistakes.

	* Makefile: Made Makefile slightly more readable.

	* Makefile, README: Noticed and fixed a discrepancy between the build
	  process and building instructions.

	* Makefile: Improved build process.
	* algo.tex: Algorithm packet is now under the GNU Free Documentation
	  License. Changed header to reflect this.
