	  installing the documentation in the proper part of the repository.

2010-06-16  Rodrigo Salazar <rsala004@ufl.edu>

	* Doxyfile, cutter.c, cutter_dynarr.h, cutter_queue.h, types.h: Doxygen
	  documentation 95% complete for sprite selection tool!!

2010-06-09  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* COPYING: Added license file to Rodrigo's sprite selection tool (which
	  really needs a better name, by the way).

2010-05-20  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* cutter.c: Minor fixes.

2010-05-20  Rodrigo Salazar <rsala004@ufl.edu>

	* cutter.c: Commited fix to important bug before I forgot about it.

2010-05-20  Rodrigo Salazar <rsala004@ufl.edu>

	* cutter.c: Added couple more color tolerance methods for more control over
	  extending components. If it doesn't work out I will move over to a more
	  advanced algorithm. Currently the program infinite loops since one of the
	  new methods is not implemented yet.

	* cutter.c: Sprite tool correctly bounded boxes around all 65 sprites in
	  easy_input.png, now works as intended!!

2010-05-17  Rodrigo Salazar <rsala004@ufl.edu>

	* cutter.c: Added source link for sprites.

2010-05-17  Rodrigo Salazar <rsala004@ufl.edu>

	* cutter.c, test_images/difficult_input.png, test_images/easy_input.png,
	  test_images/spritesheet.png: Added a spritesheet given by Preston Mueller
	  to the test_images folder, removed the original spritesheet test file and
	  replaced it with another that was less of a problem. There are now two
	  test files, easy_input and difficult_input, I hope it won't be long till
	  the program can parse the difficult_input.png, it's as difficult as can
	  be, some sprites are only one pixel apart.

2010-05-17  Preston Mueller <thepralz@gmail.com>

	* test_images/Items.png, test_images/Sprites.png, test_images/Tiles.png:
	  Added some new sprite sheets.

2010-05-17  Rodrigo Salazar <rsala004@ufl.edu>

	* .cproject, .project: Uploaded as working eclipse C project, requires CDT
	  plugin. I have it with correct working linking settings, not sure if
	  that's included in .poject files.

2010-05-17  Rodrigo Salazar <rsala004@ufl.edu>

	* test_images, test_images/spritesheet.png: Uploaded test spritesheet.

2010-05-17  Rodrigo Salazar <rsala004@ufl.edu>

	* cutter.c, cutter_dynarr.h, cutter_queue.h, types.h: Sprite selection tool
	  is now its own full fledged project.
