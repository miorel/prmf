	* bs-main-201106202315.sh, bs-main-201106241845.sh: Library upgrade.
	* chroot.sh: Added code that: sets locale, hostname, Portage options, and
	  /etc/fstab (among other things); installs a kernel and a few required
	  system tools; changes root password to randomly generated "word".
	* confset.pl: Perl script to facilitate changing configuration. It's okay
	  to use Perl here because this will run in the changed root (which comes
	  with Perl).
	* grub.conf: Basic bootloader configuration file.
	* main.sh: Changes to support the improvements to chroot.sh.
	* Makefile: There's a Makefile now, although it does just run build.sh
	  currently.

	* bs-main-201106202315.sh: Added in bigstick library.
	* build.sh: Wrote up build script that uses shellpack to get everything
	  into one file.
	* chroot.sh: Created empty stub file for code that will run with a changed
	  root.
	* main.sh: Refactored partition deletion as function. Copied in a few more
	  functions from old code. Changed importing to use new build process.
	  Started using a bunch of functions from bigstick library for cleaner and
	  more robust code. Added code to mount partitions and download/extract
	  stage/Portage snapshot.
	* make.conf: Set up preliminary Portage configuration file.
	* spec.txt: Marked completed stuff in the spec.
