	* main.sh: Starting work on 0.0.2, version string will be marked with pre
	  for now. First improvement was fixing permissions on the /dev/null that's 
	  reated.
	* build.sh, Makefile: Rewrote contents of build.sh in Makefile and removed.
	* .: Added output files to svn:ignore.
	* chroot.sh: Commented out dev-libs/glib update: it was initially added in
	  the hope that it might fix the genkernel problems, but this doesn't seem
	  to be the case. Added GNU label to /etc/issue (so we get GNU/Linux in the
	  system name rather than just Linux, yay). Setting rc_logger to "YES" in
	  /etc/rc.conf. Setting windowkeys to "YES" in /etc/conf.d/keymaps.

	* main.sh: The cancel countdown now comes with a more helpful message, and
	  the hostname is now randomly chosen from a list of antarctic islands (see
	  below). I'm also blessing this update as version 0.0.1!
	* random_antarctic_island.pl: Generator for random_antarctic_island.sh,
	  a script wrapper for a function that (unsurprisingly) prints the name of
	  a random antarctic island.
	* build.sh: Including random_antarctic_island.sh in the shellpacked
	  archive. Also moved a couple of statements into Makefile.
	* Makefile: Created make rule for random_antarctic_island.sh, took a couple
	  of statements from build.sh.
	* chroot.sh: Now just removes *.sh within /root (in the chrooted
	  environment) because I'm too lazy to list all the scripts that get
	  extracted. Maybe I'll change it to use a temporary directory for
	  extraction just because I'm a bit wary about mercilessly deleting scripts
	  (even if we're not expecting any but ours to be in /root).
	* spec.txt: Marked a few things as completed in the spec.

	* chroot.sh: Now creates /etc/init.d/net.eth0 symlink and activates
	  service. Set rc_sys variable in /etc/rc.conf.
	* main.sh: Added code to create /dev/null and /dev/console (they don't seem
	  to be in the stage3 archive).

2011-06-24  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* bs-main-201106202315.sh, bs-main-201106241845.sh: Library upgrade.
	* chroot.sh: Added code that: sets locale, hostname, Portage options, and
	  /etc/fstab (among other things); installs a kernel and a few required
	  system tools; changes root password to randomly generated "word".
	* confset.pl: Perl script to facilitate changing configuration. It's okay
	  to use Perl here because this will run in the changed root (which comes
	  with Perl).
	* grub.conf: Basic bootloader configuration file.
	* main.sh: Changes to support the improvements to chroot.sh.
	* Makefile: There's a Makefile now, although it does just run build.sh
	  currently.

	* bs-main-201106202315.sh: Added in bigstick library.
	* build.sh: Wrote up build script that uses shellpack to get everything
	  into one file.
	* chroot.sh: Created empty stub file for code that will run with a changed
	  root.
	* main.sh: Refactored partition deletion as function. Copied in a few more
	  functions from old code. Changed importing to use new build process.
	  Started using a bunch of functions from bigstick library for cleaner and
	  more robust code. Added code to mount partitions and download/extract
	  stage/Portage snapshot.
	* make.conf: Set up preliminary Portage configuration file.
	* spec.txt: Marked completed stuff in the spec.

	* main.sh: Threw together a quick script that sets up the partition table.

	* spec.txt: Wrote up basic project spec, beginning implementation!
