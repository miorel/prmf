 * build.xml: Made compatible with older Ant (which sadly required removing the
   skipExisting attribute in get tasks). Added download of Merapi libraries to
   download-dependencies task.
 * lib/merapi-0.0.1-doc.zip, lib/merapi-0.0.1.jar: Removed from repository,
   Merapi will now be downloaded through Ant.
 * .classpath: Updated name/location of Merapi libraries.

2010-07-19  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

 * .classpath, build.xml, src/com, src/main/java/com,
   src/main/java/com/googlecode/prmf/huabot/Huabot.java, src/repo-ant,
   src/repo-ant/Version.java: Edited the build process so the revision number
   now automatically determined and doesn't have to be hard-coded. (This
   requires SVNKit.) Also changed project layout a bit.

2010-07-12  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

 * build.xml: Created a few more specific targets, added some target
   descriptions.
 * lib/merapi-0.0.1.jar: Updated Merapi libraries.

 * src/com/googlecode/prmf/huabot/Huabot.java: Karma file writing should be more
   efficient now: iterator use leads to better lookups. Never mind that the
   limiting step is probably I/O anyway.

 * src/com/googlecode/prmf/huabot/Huabot.java: Improvements to karma
   functionality: entities no longer case sensitive (since we do vary casing in
   names); karma is now saved to file after each message that changed karma,
   rather than after every individual karma change (so negging DHNet 30 times in
   one message will be more efficient, resulting in one write rather than 30);
   plussing yourself no longer registers, instead triggers a reprimand (for this
   purpose, entities are case sensitive, meaning for example that TWW2 can't
   plus tww2, either). Also, the version command now reports the revision
   number, so we know what's running in the channel. Currently hard-coded,
   please update this manually whenever you commit changes. I'll think of
   something more clever soon.

 * src/com/googlecode/prmf/huabot/Huabot.java: This adds a function to the
   "karma" command, when it is called with no arguments, the bot will search for
   the highest and lowest karma. In the case of a tie for highest or lowest, it
   returns the first one it encounters. This also fixed a small bug with the way
   the bot handles commands with no arguments that made it think there's a
   single, empty argument.

2010-05-22  Thomas Boyd <Boyd.thomas3@gmail.com>

 * src/com/googlecode/prmf/huabot/Huabot.java: Added the ability for huabot to
   save the karma map in the text file karma.txt and read from the file to
   repopulate the map whenever a new instance of huabot is created.

 * src/com/googlecode/prmf/huabot/Huabot.java: huabot karma feature
   modifications, can now be queried using the "karma" command.

 * src/com/googlecode/prmf/huabot/Huabot.java: huabot now processes commands
   that give positive/negative karma and reports the result to the channel.
   Nothing happens besides that, though.

 * COPYING: Added license file.
