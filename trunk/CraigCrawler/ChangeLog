	* craigcrawler.pl: Changed main pattern, added additional pattern for directories, added bad_pattern array since
	I was not able to combine them into 1 super-pattern. Bug created somehow .. if spider reaches max recursion depth it freezes.
	Still not able to get spider to go all the way down to listings pages.

	* craigcrawler.pl: Erased dont_spider method because I decided its a horrible way to check for bad links.
	It might be better just to be more specific with our original pattern.. Added a list of problems to tackle!

	* craigcrawler.pl: Added a statement to remove leading slashes in directory links.
	Attempted to change one of the 'bad' patterns, currently a broken pattern which doesn't 'compile'.

	* craigcrawler.pl: Made some progress on what to spider and what not to spider, but broke the spider in the process.
	Added some very messy code.

	* craigcrawler.pl: Implemented basic spider method, which works somewhat!
	Problems: There are a TON of pages! All of 1 city took 15 minutes.

	* craigcrawler.pl: Set a layout for the first couple methods we will need to

	  methods.

2010-05-21  Rodrigo Salazar <rsala004@ufl.edu>

	* craigcrawler.pl: Added a couple lines of code, need to think about how we
	  are going to get all the interesting links from the page or whether we
	  should just pull every link and spider the entire website, checking each
	  to see if its a person listing or not. Will discuss later!
