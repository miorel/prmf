== Corleone Design Planning ==

Bot connects to IRC with config file
Waits for someone to start a mafia game
Pregame starts: People join and leave, settings are changed
Pregame ends: either someone starts the actual game or the game is ended and we go back to waiting.

Game starts: roles are handed out randomly
Until the game has ended, alternate days and nights (starting with whichever)

Day: Bot waits for votes
Once the timer expires, or the majority has come to a decision on the voting, enact that decision
Explain the results of the decision made.

Night: Bot waits for commands
Once the timer expires, or everyone with an action has given the action, enact the actions in a specific order
Explain the results
