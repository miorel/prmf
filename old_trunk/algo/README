This directory contains the LaTeX source for the algorithm packet.

On systems that have the make and pdflatex commands, execute `make' to compile
a pdf file. Two other targets of interest are `make dist', to create a source
archive, and `make clean', to remove the compilation output and any other
rebuildable files. 

There is an optional dependency on the Rubber project:
<http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~beffara/soft/rubber/>
The build process will try to use Rubber if it is available, generally
resulting in fewer passes of the source and, consequently, faster compilation.
You are therefore encouraged to install Rubber if you will be actively editing
the algorithm packet.
