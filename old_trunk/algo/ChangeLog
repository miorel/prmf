	* algo.tex: Quick syntax fix of the cross product section.
	* pp.png: Deleted, replacing with pp_vol.pdf (see below).
	* pp_vol.pdf: Importing parallelepiped volume picture -- Inkscape PDF
	  save of public domain file
	  <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Parallelepiped_volume.svg>
	  by Jitse Niesen.
	* Makefile: Listed pp_vol.pdf under RES.

	* algo.tex: Added section on cross products.
	* pp.png: Got parallelepiped image from Wikimedia Commons.

	* Makefile: Created target for date.txt, which will hold the algorithm
	  packet's last modification time.
	* .: Added date.txt to svn:ignore, as it will be generated during the
	  build process.
	* algo.tex: The date on the cover is now the last modification time
	  (sourced from date.txt) instead of the build time. Added footnote
	  about DOTALL to regex syntax summary. Replaced use of \verb with
	  \lstinline. Fixed a typo.

	* gc_upload.pl, googlecode.config.example: Created script (and example
	  configuration) for uploading the algorithm packet and source archive
	  to the Downloads section of the Google Code repository. I'm not sure
	  if this script belongs in the source archive, defaulting to no, as
	  anyone who might run this ought to have the source from the
	  repository anyway.
	* .: Added googlecode.config to svn:ignore to minimize typing without
	  the need to upload Google Code credentials to the repository.
	* test.pl: Created script for checking that the algorithm packet and
	  source archive build successfully. Reports through exit code. It may
	  be useful to have a post-commit hook run this script and make fun of
	  anyone adding broken stuff to the repository. Unlike the other
	  script, this one might have a purpose in a source archive, will
	  think about it.
	* Makefile: The pdflatex commands are now wrapped in {} instead of ().

	* README, toc.pl: Fixed some quotes.
	* algo.tex: Updated header.

2010-09-29  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* Makefile: Replaced use of the which command with the type command.
	  Defined some commands (namely rubber and zip) and their
	  corresponding flags as variables, thus making the build process more
	  configurable. Yay!
	* algo.tex: Corrected some embarrassing spelling/grammar mistakes.

2010-07-08  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* Makefile: Made Makefile slightly more readable.

2010-07-08  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* Makefile, README: Noticed and fixed a discrepancy between the build
	  process and building instructions.

2010-05-20  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* Makefile: Improved build process.
	* algo.tex: Algorithm packet is now under the GNU Free Documentation
	  License. Changed header to reflect this.

2010-05-19  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* Makefile: Compiling now requires less typing.
	* README, algo.tex, toc.pl: Minor improvements.

2010-04-30  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* README: Updated instructions.
	* toc.pl: Created script for extracting the algorithm packet table of
	  contents in Google Code wiki format.

2010-04-27  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* algo.tex: Added header to algorithm packet source.

2010-04-19  Miorel-Lucian Palii <mlpalii@gmail.com>

	* README: Created instructions for compiling the algorithm packet.
	* icpc.png: Imported ACM ICPC logo from <http://icpc.baylor.edu/>.

	* algo.tex: Algorithm packet LaTeX source added to repository.
